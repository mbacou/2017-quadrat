["quadrant-classification.html", "Section 2 Quadrant Classification", " Section 2 Quadrant Classification Maps showing quadrant classification for Ghana and Nigeria. In this iteration the steps are as follow: Start from GLUES agricultural suitability map for West Africa (all crops combined) at 1km resolution Mask out forest and urban areas based on ESA Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification at 300m resolution. The exact classes that are considered not (low) suitable are: Tab. 2.1: LULC Categories not Suitable for Farming (Source: ESA/CCI Land Cover Classification, 2015) Code Label 50 Tree cover, broadleaved, evergreen, closed to open (&gt;15%) 60 Tree cover, broadleaved, deciduous, closed to open (&gt;15%) 61 Tree cover, broadleaved, deciduous, closed (&gt;40%) 62 Tree cover, broadleaved, deciduous, open (15-40%) 70 Tree cover, needleleaved, evergreen, closed to open (&gt;15%) 71 Tree cover, needleleaved, evergreen, closed (&gt;40%) 72 Tree cover, needleleaved, evergreen, open (15-40%) 80 Tree cover, needleleaved, deciduous, closed to open (&gt;15%) 81 Tree cover, needleleaved, deciduous, closed (&gt;40%) 82 Tree cover, needleleaved, deciduous, open (15-40%) 90 Tree cover, mixed leaf type (broadleaved and needleleaved) 160 Tree cover, flooded, fresh or brakish water 170 Tree cover, flooded, saline water 180 Shrub or herbaceous cover, flooded, fresh/saline/brakish water 190 Urban areas 200 Bare areas 201 Consolidated bare areas 202 Unconsolidated bare areas 210 Water bodies 220 Permanent snow and ice Mask out protected areas by rasterizing the 2017 version of the IUCN World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) shapefile to 1km resolution (shown below) Classify the resulting raster into zones of low/high suitability using a cutoff at 40%. Overlay the resulting suitability raster with IFPRI/HarvestChoice Travel Time to 100K Market reclassified into zones of low/high market access using a cutoff at 4hrs (2010 version resampled from 10km to 1km) Showing protected areas not suited for agriculture. Agricultural suitability (after masking out unsuitable land use/cover classes and protected areas). The final quadrant classifications are shown below after overlaying zones of low/high market access (using below/above 4hrs to nearest 100K market for the 2 countries). "],
